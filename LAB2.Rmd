### Simulating Data in R

General Strategy
The basic approach to simulating data|making \fake" data|is to (1) take the statistical model,
(2) pick some parameter values, and (3) use the random form of the model's probability distribution,
with the model embedded inside it, to generate random samples. So for a model yi  Zink( +
xi; 
), data can be simulated from the model using:
a <- 3
b <- 0.5
g <- 12
y <- rzink( n , a + b*x , g )
where a, b, and g are the parameters, x is a vector of (possibly fake) prediction values, and n is
equal to the length of x, the number of y values to generate.
Gaussian Example
Suppose we have a Gaussian regression model, yi  N( + 1xi + 2zi; ). You know the built-in
density function for Gaussian values is dnorm. The corresponding function to generate random
Gaussian values is rnorm|this is almost always the case, that the random function is named after
the density function, by changing the initial \d" to a \r". To simulate:
a <- 7.2
b1 <- 2.1
b2 <- -5
s <- 3
y <- rnorm( length(x) , mean=a + b1*x + b2*z , sd=s )
The vector y will hold randomly sampled Gaussian values.
