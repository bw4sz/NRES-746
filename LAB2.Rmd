#### QUESTION 1
Generate a dataset that violates one or more of the basic assumptions of standard linear regression. Make sure your dataset is biologically realistic! Justify in writing how biological processes could have produced the data, including (especially) the assumptions violation(s).

Some options: 
* use a non-normal error distribution
* introduce temporal autocorrelation
* introduce other types of correlation structure among the observations
* introduce a high-leverage outlier that comes from a different data-generating process

Use standard linear regression to analyze these data. 

Answer the following questions:

1. Is the estimate of the regression parameter *biased*?
2. How well does the confidence interval for the regression parameter match the true confidence interval? (this is a test for *precision*)
3. How well does the prediction interval match the true prediction interval?
4. Try some common data transformations to "correct" for any assumptions violations. For example, you might log transform 


#### QUESTION 2
Power analysis. 

### Simulating Data in R

General Strategy
The basic approach to simulating data|making \fake" data|is to (1) take the statistical model,
(2) pick some parameter values, and (3) use the random form of the model's probability distribution,
with the model embedded inside it, to generate random samples. So for a model yi  Zink( +
xi; 
), data can be simulated from the model using:
a <- 3
b <- 0.5
g <- 12
y <- rzink( n , a + b*x , g )
where a, b, and g are the parameters, x is a vector of (possibly fake) prediction values, and n is
equal to the length of x, the number of y values to generate.
Gaussian Example
Suppose we have a Gaussian regression model, yi  N( + 1xi + 2zi; ). You know the built-in
density function for Gaussian values is dnorm. The corresponding function to generate random
Gaussian values is rnorm|this is almost always the case, that the random function is named after
the density function, by changing the initial \d" to a \r". To simulate:
a <- 7.2
b1 <- 2.1
b2 <- -5
s <- 3
y <- rnorm( length(x) , mean=a + b1*x + b2*z , sd=s )
The vector y will hold randomly sampled Gaussian values.
