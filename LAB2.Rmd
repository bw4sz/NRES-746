## Final Projects

Take some time to start forming groups (2-3 people) for final projects.

### General expectations

I will provide a more formal list of expectations for final projects soon, but in a nutshell (and in no particular order), you are expected to perform and write up the results for a sophisticated data analysis using *state-of-the-art analytical methods*. The write-up will loosely take the format of a scientific paper to be submitted to a professional journal. However, because of the nature of this course, the most important pieces of the write-up are the methods and results sections. Nonetheless, I expect at least a few paragraphs introducing the topic and why it's important, and a few paragraphs discussing the implications of the results. The methods and results section can (and in many cases should) be much longer than you typically see in a scientific paper- don't feel constrained by space for these sections! Not that you need to be wordy, I just want to make sure you have the space to clearly explain the analyses you performed and why you made the choices you did.  

### Picking a topic

Your final project should not be part of your thesis. That said, there is no requirement that your final project is not *relevant* to your graduate thesis project. You will end up spending quite a bit of time on your final projects, so think about what types of analyses you want/need to get to know better- ideally something that may strengthen your thesis project. 

### Picking a dataset

You are not required to use a public dataset, but there are lots of great datasets out there... see [links page](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-746/Links.html#Data_links)

#### QUESTION 1
Develop a 1-page "proposal" that briefly describes your research question, your study system, the data set you will use, and what methods you plan to use to test your research question. Proposals are due to me by Monday 26 September. All groups should meet with me briefly to go over project ideas in lab on September 29!

## The Virtual Ecologist

### Simulating Data in R

First, review the basic approach to simulating data in the ["Virtual Ecologist" lecture](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-746/LECTURE3.html).

#### QUESTION 2
Write an R function to generate data that violates *one or more* of the basic assumptions regarding the error distribution of standard linear regression. Make sure your dataset is biologically realistic! Justify in writing how biological processes could have produced the data, including (especially) the assumptions violation(s). NOTE: you must specify a linear relationship between your response and predictor (otherwise some of the questions below wouldn't make sense!). 

Some options: 

* use a non-normal error distribution
* introduce temporal autocorrelation
* introduce other types of correlation structure among the observations
* introduce a high-leverage outlier 
* use a mixture of two error distributions
* others?? (feel free to be creative!)

Use classical linear regression to analyze these data. 

Answer the following questions (keep verbiage to a minimum, and provide all code- with comments!)

1. Is the estimate of the regression parameter *biased*? [note: statistical bias of an estimator is the difference between the estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated]
2. How well does the *confidence interval* for the regression parameter match the true confidence interval for the regression parameter? (this is a test for *precision*)
3. Try some common data transformations to correct for any assumptions violations. For example, you might log transform, arcsine transform, logit transform, etc... Do these transformations improve the degree to which the regression analysis estimates match the 
4. Evaluate *goodness-of-fit* by visualizing the (fake, untransformed) data against the range of data likely to be produced under the regression model. Were your data.

#### QUESTION 3
Power analysis.
