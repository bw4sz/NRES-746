Armed with basic concepts of probability and statistics, and with some facility with computer programming, ecologists and natural resource professionals can get more out of their data than ever before by using (or programming their own) algorithms that can account for biological realities that would have been ignored under traditional statistical models. In this course, we fully accept and embrace the primacy of the algorithm. By the end of this course, students should have the ability to program and/or make use of a wide variety of data analysis algorithms. The goal is for students to emerge from this course as creative ecological data analysts with the tools needed to make sense of a wide variety of data types. \n**The course motto**: *be dangerous*!  \nThe focus is on using statistical and computational methods to infer ecological process or relationships from pattern in observational studies; we will not directly address experimental methods or design in this course. However, the data analysis methods covered will be of broad utility for a wide variety of disciplines. The general focus will be predictive statistical modeling methods, including regression-based approaches, hierarchical and mixed models, multi-model inference, ensemble methods, maximum entropy models, classification and regression trees, random forest, and structural equation modeling, and geographic models of species distributions. With regard to each topic, we will explore the underlying scientific issues and questions of interest, the most commonly employed statistical methods, recent methodological developments, pitfalls to watch out for, and methods for getting around the pitfalls. \n\n*Note that this is not a \"statistics\" course per se*; I focus on the implementation and leave the nitty-gritty stats questions to statisticians (or more often textbooks written by statisticians)\nThis course is an advanced graduate seminar, and will strongly feature student-led discussions. Instructor-led lectures will be kept to a minimum, and each student will be responsible for leading discussions on data analysis methods and results. The laboratory portion of the class will provide students the opportunity to try out some of the data analysis methods. Structured labs with example data sets will be interspersed with open lab periods where students work in small groups on a research project involving analysis of a real-world data set. \n\n### Student Learning Objectives\n1. Identify and contrast the major classes of statistical models used by ecologists (e.g., Bayesian vs frequentist, likelihood-based, machine learning) and explain how and why ecologists use these models. \n2. Apply advanced analysis tools such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Bayesian inference, and Random Forest (RF) on diverse data sets representative of those commonly considered in observational studies in ecology.\n3. Learn to explore data sets quantitatively and graphically and to prepare data appropriately for analysis. \n4. Perform statistical analysis, data visualization, simulation modeling, model validation and basic programming with the statistical computing language R.\n5. Critically evaluate the strength of inferences drawn from statistical models by understanding and testing major assumptions and using tools such as cross-validation.\n6. Communicate statistical concepts by leading lectures and discussion on advanced topics in data analysis.\n\n### Prerequisites\nCurious scientific mind, broad research interests, comfort with (or at least, lack of fear regarding) quantitative topics and basic mathematics. Students are expected to already have a fundamental knowledge of relevant statistical methods, obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case, they should be prepared to work harder to develop the necessary prerequisite knowledge.\n\n### Textbooks and Readings\nWe will use the book, \"Ecological Models and Data in R\", by Ben Bolker, as a general class reference. However, numerous readings will be assigned, and will be available on the course website. \nThere is no textbook, but numerous readings will be assigned as indicated in the course schedule and bibliography. For the discussions for which they will be responsible for leading, students will be able, with the instructor's permission, to substitute readings of their own choice for the \"default\" ones suggested by the instructor. \n\n### Grading\nModerated Discussions \t20%\nClass Participation\t\t20%\nShort Laboratory Reports\t20%\nResearch Project\t\t40% (30% manuscript, 10% presentation)\nDiscussion: Each student will be responsible for leading two class discussions on relevant papers. For each 45-minute discussion session, of which there will be one or two per week, students will read 1-2 papers selected by the instructor or by the student (with instructor permission). The discussion will include an initial description of the general topic of the paper, designed to set the stage and pose interesting questions for a fruitful exchange of ideas. Discussion leaders are encouraged to review other relevant literature and integrate this into the discussion. Discussion leaders are encouraged to work with the instructor to better understand their papers and topics. Additional instructions for discussion leaders will be handed out early in the semester.\nClass Participation: Students are expected to actively participate in the classroom education process, during both lectures and discussions, but particularly during discussions. Each class discussion period, the instructor will rank on a 1 - 5 scale the level of each student's participation. Students will be judged both on quantity and quality of their participation.\nLaboratory Reports: Students will submit a brief report (??? 3 pages) summarizing each laboratory activity, succinctly answering any questions posed, and stating any questions or uncertainties the students would like the instructor to address. While students will work on the labs in small groups, individual lab reports will be submitted. \nGroup Projects: Students will work on projects in groups of 2 - 3 people. Projects will require analysis of previously published or new, publicly available data sets that are NOT intended to be part of a student's planned thesis or dissertation chapters. The instructor can assist with identifying suitable data sets. Although a primary goal is to enhance knowledge and facility with the data analysis methods, an important secondary goal could be to develop a collaborative manuscript for peer-reviewed publication! Therefore, careful thought should go into choice of a data set and relevant scientific questions to guide the analysis. \nThe group project will take the form of a manuscript in a specified journal format, suitable for submission as a research paper. This will be submitted to the instructor as a complete draft by [TBD], and (after review and comment by the instructor) as a final version by [TBD]. \n\n\n",
