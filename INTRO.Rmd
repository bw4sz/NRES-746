## Welcome to NRES 746!

In this class we will survey a broad range of data analysis methods, with a focus on developing creative algorithms for solving non-standard problems (which in ecology and natural resources management means pretty much every dataset you will ever encounter)

## Syllabus:

First let's take a walk through the online syllabus:

## Introductions

Let's take some time go around the room and introduce each other and what we are hoping to get out of this course. 

Remember, this is my first time teaching this course and I need your frequent and honest feedback in order to make sure that the level is appropriae and the topics are useful

Please take the time to introduce yourself in more detail on the ["canvas" site](https://unr.instructure.com/courses/4594). I have set up a question on the discussion board.  

## Textbook

Please order the course textbook (Ecological Modeling and Data in R, by Ben Bolker) as soon as possible. I would recommend buying the textbook on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Models-Data-Benjamin-Bolker/dp/0691125228)


## Learning R

All of you should have R and RStudio installed on your computers. See the [links page](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-746/) for some useful references.
